\vspace*{1em}
\noindent
Since the early years of computer science navigation tasks were heavily explored. Since most of these tasks are NP-hard, even modern computers struggle with the optimal solution of larger instances for those problems. To overcome this problem various approximation algorithms have been developed to get usable results in a relatively short time. In this work we focus on a specific problem: The navigation of particles by a single global force - also known as tilt problem. We exploit recent developments in the area of reinforcement learning to navigate all particles to a given goal position and compare the results to state-of-the-art approximation algorithms. % Running todo
